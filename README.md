# FrozenLake DQN
A research project with the aim of exploring deep q-learning as a tool to navigate dynamic maps. I utilized [FrozenLake](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) environment as a research platform, developed a data pipeline to extract states as images, and generated optimal policy using a two-part neural network.

### Project Status
This project is an ongoing effort. The goal is to incorporate randomness in map layout and slipperiness to increase complexity and evaluate the performance of a deep Q-learning approach.
